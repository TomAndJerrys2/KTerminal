# Kyle's Custom Shell for GNU Systems
Designed for Unix Systems. It was meant as an extension tool and a way to learn about the unix shell and its commands. While making this
I added a lot of useful features for which i found to be helpful whilst in development or using linux in general. Whilst this is not supposed to be very flashy
I tried to make the feature set as lightweight but robust as possible and making the error handling precise.
